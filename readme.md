TOP: ETCH-A-SKETCH

Practising fundamentals in DOM manipulation; query selectors, event listeners/handlers, element creation etc.

Create an interactive "etch-a-sketch" for the browser exclusively through the DOM. 

The task prompt was to use either of the following to create the intial grid: 
    
    float/clear
    inline-block
    flexbox
    Grid

Grid seemed the natural choice because of how it would handle the grid shape but I chose flexbox to go back over
some old ground as well as see how using JS to manipulate flex would pan out.
